Project 2 Instructions

Your new client is a health insurance company. After a lengthy review of their business, the insurance company has decided to prioritize improvements in medication adherence. For our initial work, we will focus on patients with heart disease and how well they take their medications.

Your team has received some modest training from a physician. Here are the basic facts you need to know. Heart disease is one of the most pervasive health problems, especially for older patients. The initial diagnosis typically occurs too late. Most patients only become aware that they have heart disease after experiencing an acute episode. This can be limited to moderate symptoms, which might be treated by either medications or a light procedure. In more severe cases, the patient might suffer a major event such as a myocardial infarction (heart attack) or need a significant surgical operation. Whether minor or major, these events often include a hospitalization. After the initial diagnosis, patients are typically prescribed a range of medications. Three primary therapies include ACE inhibitors, beta blockers, and statins.

The insurance company has helpfully compiled data on a large number of patients. They have included a number of important clinical factors about their baseline conditions. Then, starting from the time of their initial diagnoses of heart disease, the patients were tracked based upon which medications were filled at the pharmacy. The medication records are presented in the form of panel data. A single patient’s records are linked by a unique identifier. The time measurements represent the number of days since baseline. Prescriptions are typically filled for 30 or 90 days of medications. For this study, you may assume that the patients qualified for our study and reasonably could have been expected to be prescribed all of the medicines we are tracking.

In this project, you will develop an approach to working with the information. The client company has provided a list of questions they would like to address. In addition to building the report, our team would also like you to present recommendations on how to improve upon the infrastructure. We also want you to identify opportunities for the client to make use of the information you’re working with in novel ways.

This project is divided into 4 parts:

Part 1: Summarizing the data.
Part 2: Answering specific question about medication adherence.
Part 3: Generalizing and automating the reporting infrastructure for use beyond the current version.
Part 4: Identifying opportunities.
